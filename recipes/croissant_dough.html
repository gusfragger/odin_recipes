    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It's important not to try to halve this recipe. When you need only a half recipe of dough, as for the pains au
        chocolat,
        use the rest of the dough for a batch of Parma braids or a princess ring. Or make a double recipe of those
        irresistible
        chocolate croissants and share them with friends. One batch of this dough is enough for 24 plain croissants, 32
        chocolate croissants, 16 Parma braids, or 2 princess rings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk, heated to warm (105°F–110°F)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast (from two 1/4-oz packages)</li>
        <li>3 3/4 to 4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 kitchen towels (not terry cloth)</li>
        <li>1 ruler</li>
        <li>1 pastry brush</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together warm milk, brown sugar, and yeast in bowl of standing mixer and let stand until foamy, about 5
            minutes.
            (If it doesn’t foam, discard and start over.) Add 3 3/4 cups flour and salt and mix with dough hook at low speed
            until
            dough is smooth and very soft, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a work surface and knead by hand 2 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, a little at a
            time, to
            make a soft, slightly sticky dough. Form dough into a roughly 1 1/2-inch-thick rectangle and chill, wrapped in
            plastic
            wrap, until cold, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After dough has chilled, arrange sticks of butter horizontally, their sides touching, on a work surface. Pound
            butter
            with a rolling pin to soften slightly (butter should be malleable but still cold). Scrape butter into a block
            and put on
            a kitchen towel, then cover with other towel. Pound and roll out on both sides until butter forms a uniform 8-
            by 5-inch
            rectangle. Chill, wrapped in towels, while rolling out dough.</li>
        <li>Unwrap dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as necessary and lifting and
            stretching dough
            (especially in corners), into a 16- by 10-inch rectangle. Arrange dough with a short side nearest you. Put
            butter in
            center of dough so that long sides of butter are parallel to short sides of dough. Fold as you would a letter:
            bottom
            third of dough over butter, then top third down over dough. Brush off excess flour with pastry brush.</li>
        <li>Turn dough so a short side is nearest you, then flatten dough slightly by pressing down horizontally with
            rolling pin
            across dough at regular intervals, making uniform impressions. Roll out dough into a 15- by 10-inch rectangle,
            rolling
            just to but not over ends.</li>
        <li>Brush off any excess flour. Fold in thirds like a letter, as above, stretching corners to square off dough,
            forming a
            10- by 5-inch rectangle. (You have completed the first "fold.") Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Make 3 more folds in same manner, chilling dough 1 hour after each fold, for a total of 4 folds. (If any butter
            oozes
            out while rolling, sprinkle with flour to prevent sticking.) Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill at
            least 8
            hours but no more than 18 (after 18 hours, dough may not rise sufficiently when baked)</li>
